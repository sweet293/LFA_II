# Topic: Intro to formal languages. Regular grammars. Finite Automata.



## Course: Formal Languages & Finite Automata


## Overview

In this homework assignment, the objective was to delve into the concept of formal languages and understand the essential components required for a language to be considered formal. A formal language comprises an alphabet, vocabulary, and grammar, each serving a distinct purpose in conveying information effectively from a sender to a receiver.

## Objectives

The primary objectives of this project are:

1. To understand the definition and characteristics of a formal language.
2. To set up an initial framework for a project that evolves throughout the semester.
3. To demonstrate proficiency in handling laboratory tasks and projects related to formal languages.

## Tasks

1. GitHub Repository Setup:
Created a GitHub repository to store and manage the project code.
2. Programming Language Selection:
Chose a programming language suitable for implementing the project tasks efficiently.
3. Report Storage:
Reports are stored separately to facilitate easy verification of the work done.
4. Grammar Implementation:
Implemented a type/class to represent the grammar of the language.
5. Added functionality to generate five valid strings from the defined grammar.
Implemented functionality to convert a Grammar object to a Finite Automaton object.
6. Finite Automaton Implementation:
Added a method to the Finite Automaton to check if an input string can be obtained via state transitions.
